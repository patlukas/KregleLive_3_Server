# KregleLive_3_Server

KregleLive_3_Server is an application designed to "listen" to messages transmitted via a serial port between a computer and bowling lanes. The application processes these messages and forwards them via TCP protocol to the [KregleLive_3_Client](https://github.com/patlukas/KregleLive_3_Client), which is part of a larger project. KregleLive_3_Server is intended to run on Windows XP, which is why it was written in Python 3.4.3.

To test the application's response to messages from the lanes, a testing tool is provided in the form of the **KregleLive_3_FakeLaneSim** application, available in the repository [link](https://github.com/patlukas/KregleLive_3_FakeLaneSim). This tool simulates the messages sent from the bowling lanes, allowing you to verify that **KregleLive_3_Server** correctly processes and forwards the data to the **KregleLive_3_Client**.

## Features

- **Serial Port Monitoring**: The application listens to messages transmitted via the COM port between the computer and the bowling lanes.
- **Message Processing**: Captured messages are processed and forwarded to KregleLive_3_Client via TCP protocol.
- **Configuration via JSON**: The application is configured using a `config.json` file, which allows customization of parameters such as COM ports, timeouts, log priorities, etc.
- **Executable Generation**: The application can be compiled into an executable (`.exe`) using PyInstaller.

## Recommended Software

- Operating System: Windows XP
- Python 3.4.3
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
  - PyQt5 (version 5.4.1)
- `pyinstaller` for generating the executable
- **com0com**: Version 3.0.0.0 is recommended for creating virtual COM ports.

## Installation and Setup

### Steps to Build the Executable (`.exe`)

1. Install `pyinstaller`:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Set the path to the project:
   ```bash
   set path=C:\path\to\KregleLive_3_Server
   ```

3. Generate the executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller.exe %path%\main.py --icon %path%\icon\icon.ico --name KL3S.exe --onefile --noconsole
   ```

   The executable will be generated in the `dist` folder.

### Alternatively

You can download the pre-built executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/patlukas/KregleLive_3_Server/releases) section.

## Configuration

The application is configured using the `config.json` file. Below is a description of the parameters:

- `path_to_dict_com0com`: Path to the `com0com` directory (recommended version: 3.0.0.0), which is required to create a virtual COM port for message transmission.
- `path_to_run_kegeln_program`: Path to the third-party program used to manage the bowling lanes.
- `flags_to_run_kegeln_program`: Arguments to run the above program (suggested: `"w b6 a x"`).
- `com_x`: COM port on which data is received from the lanes to the computer.
- `com_y`: COM port used for outgoing data from the application to the "kegeln" program.
- `com_z`: COM port used for incoming data to the "kegeln" program.
- `com_timeout`: Timeout for reading messages from the COM port.
- `com_write_timeout`: Timeout for writing messages to the COM port.
- `minimum_number_of_lines_to_write_in_log_file`: Number of new logs after which the physical log file is updated.
- `time_interval_break`: Break time (in seconds) between loop intervals.
- `min_log_priority`: Default minimum log priority that will be visible in the GUI (can be changed in gui).
- `default_ip`: Default IP address on which the application will listen for TCP connections (can be selected in gui).
- `default_port`: Default port used for TCP communication (can be changed in the GUI).

## Running the Application

After configuring the `config.json` file, run the `KL3S.exe` application. The application will automatically start listening on the specified COM ports.

## Logs

The application generates logs, which are written to a file. The minimum log priority visible in the GUI can be set in the configuration file.

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
